# DevOps Agent Context

## Recent Context
First working heartbeat on April 13. Oriented on full cabinet state. Created OB-2 rollback runbook, monitoring requirements page, and updated release checklist with operational specifics. Sent messages to CTO (asking about tooling and RT-4 delivery telemetry) and QA (coordinating OB-2 pre-release testing).

## Key Decisions
- Treating OB-2 as a full pipeline rehearsal — even though it's a copy-only change, running the complete release process to surface gaps before higher-risk releases.
- Defined monitoring tiers: Tier 1 (trust metrics, alert immediately), Tier 2 (product health, daily review), Tier 3 (infrastructure, background).
- Rollback plan for OB-2: halt staged rollout, revert commit, submit hotfix. Android near-instant, iOS 4-6h with expedited review.

## Learnings
- No release has ever shipped from the sprint backlog. The pipeline is completely untested.
- Reminders are device-local with no server-side delivery logs. This means we are blind to reminder delivery failures.
- 26 stories in "Ready" state, zero in progress. The team needs velocity, not more planning.
- CAC is $223 per paying user. Activation and retention improvements are survival metrics.
- CTO took ownership of RT-4 on April 13. Findings expected by end of week (April 18).

## Open Questions
- What analytics/crash tooling is currently live? (Asked CTO)
- Do we have any reminder delivery telemetry today? (Asked CTO)
- What CI/CD exists for building and signing? (Unknown — will surface during OB-2 dry run)

## Focus for Next Heartbeat
- Confirm RT-4 findings from CTO (due Apr 18) — assess P2 timeline impact
- Check whether PC-3 and OB-5 have landed; verify conversion and onboarding drop-off rates are stable
- Confirm OB-2 pipeline dry run has been completed and release checklist updated
- Check for CTO response on analytics/crash tooling and delivery telemetry


## 2026-04-16 — Daily Bug Triage
Reviewed all 5 bugs in bug-triage.csv. Enriched with DevOps severity guidance, fix targets, and risk framing. Updated CSV in place.

**Triage summary (by priority):**
1. **RT-4 (Critical) — Reminder 2h late** — Highest risk item in the entire product. Blocks P2. CTO investigation due April 18. Architecture risk: if fix requires server-side push migration, P2 expands by 2+ sprints. Zero delivery telemetry until fixed.
2. **PC-3 (High) — Paywall dismiss clipped** — Ship this sprint. Bounded fix (<1 day). App Store compliance + conversion risk. Already in sprint plan.
3. **SK-2 (High) — Streak resets on timezone change** — Defer to P3, but do not let it slip past. Must ship with SK-6 test suite. Silent churn risk.
4. **OB-5 (Medium) — Nickname not shown in setup** — Ship this sprint with OB-6 analytics. Low operational risk.
5. **Reply flicker (Low)** — Backlog. No trust impact.

**Standing risk:** No server-side delivery logs. Reminders are still device-local. Tier 1 monitoring (delivery success rate, latency) is unmeasurable until RT-4 fix lands.

First working heartbeat. Created OB-2 rollback runbook with staged rollout plan, monitoring thresholds, and rollback procedure. Updated release checklist with operational specifics and documented open gaps. Created monitoring requirements page with three-tier framework. Sent messages to CTO requesting tooling inventory and delivery telemetry assessment, and to QA for OB-2 testing coordination. Biggest finding: zero delivery observability exists — reminders are device-local with no server-side logs.
