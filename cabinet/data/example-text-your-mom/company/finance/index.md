# Unit Economics & Runway

CFO analysis of Text Your Mom's subscription economics, acquisition efficiency, and spending posture. Updated each heartbeat.

## April 13, 2026 — First CFO Review

### The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Current | Target | CFO Read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MAU | 18,400 | 50,000 | 2.7x growth needed in 10 weeks |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 3.5% | 5% | ~644 paying users today (estimated) |
| Blended CAC | $7.80 | < $6.00 | Tolerable only if organic mix increases |
| Week-4 retention | 28% | 35% | This is the number that scares me most |
| Activation rate | 41% | 55% | 59% of installs produce zero revenue potential |

### Unit Economics (Estimated)

Pricing is not documented in the KB. The analysis below assumes a consumer subscription at ~$4.99/month (or ~$35/year annual plan). **The CEO or product team should confirm actual pricing and update this section.**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Estimated paying users | ~644 | 18,400 MAU x 3.5% conversion |
| Effective CAC per paying user | ~$223 | $7.80 blended CAC / 3.5% conversion |
| Monthly revenue per subscriber | ~$4.99 | Assumed — needs confirmation |
| Estimated MRR | ~$3,214 | 644 x $4.99 |
| Estimated ARR | ~$38,568 | MRR x 12 |
| Payback period (at current CAC) | ~45 months | $223 / $4.99 — catastrophic |
| Required LTV for 3:1 ratio | ~$669 | Would need ~134 months of retention at $4.99 |

**Bottom line: Paid acquisition is economically unviable at current conversion and CAC.** Every dollar we spend on paid acquisition at $7.80 CAC with 3.5% conversion takes nearly 4 years to recover. This is not a tuning problem — it is a structural gap.

### What This Means for Growth Strategy

**Content-led growth is not a nice-to-have. It is the only path to a sustainable business.**

If we acquire 31,600 users to hit the 50K MAU target entirely through paid channels at $7.80 each, that costs ~$246,000. We cannot afford that, and even if we could, the payback math does not work.

The only way the MAU target makes financial sense:

1. **Organic acquisition must be the majority channel.** TikTok and Reddit content that costs time, not ad dollars. If organic delivers 80% of new users, blended CAC drops to ~$1.50, and payback falls to ~9 months at current conversion. That is survivable.
2. **Conversion must improve.** Every percentage point of conversion halves the effective CAC per paying user. Moving from 3.5% to 5% drops the effective cost from $223 to $156. Still not great, but trending right.
3. **Retention is the real leverage.** A user who retains 12+ months at $4.99/month has an LTV of ~$60. At 28% week-4 retention, most users churn before they ever generate enough revenue to cover acquisition. **Improving retention from 28% to 35% does more for LTV than any conversion optimization.**

### Priority Sequence Is Financially Correct

The roadmap runs P1 (activation) → P2 (retention) → P3 (retention) → P4 (conversion). This is the right order from a unit economics perspective:

| Priority | Financial Impact |
| --- | --- |
| P1 Onboarding v2 | Activation 41% → 55% = 34% more users reaching "revenue possible" state |
| P2 Smarter Timing | Retention 28% → 32%+ = longer LTV, lower effective CAC |
| P3 Streaks | Retention boost + paywall trigger (streak milestone = conversion moment) |
| P4 Paid Conversion | Conversion 3.5% → 5% = 43% more paying users per cohort |

Compounding these improvements:
- **Today:** 1,000 installs → 410 activated → 115 retained at W4 → 4 paying = 0.4% install-to-paid
- **Post-P1 through P4:** 1,000 installs → 550 activated → 193 retained at W4 → 10 paying = 1.0% install-to-paid

That is a 2.5x improvement in funnel efficiency. Combined with organic growth, the economics start working.

### Retention: The Number That Keeps Me Up

28% week-4 retention means we lose 72% of users within a month. At this rate:

- Most users generate **zero lifetime revenue** — they churn before converting
- The only users who matter financially are the ones who survive month 1
- Every dollar spent acquiring a user who churns in week 2 is wasted

**The single most valuable thing this company can do right now is ship P2 (smarter timing).** But P2 is blocked by the RT-4 bug ("Reminder sent 2 hours late"), which has no assignee. This is a financial emergency disguised as a technical one.

### Spending Posture: Hold

Given the current economics:

- **Do not increase paid acquisition spend.** The payback math does not justify it.
- **Invest time (not dollars) in content-led growth.** Activate TikTok and Reddit this week.
- **Treat RT-4 bug assignment as a financial priority.** It gates the entire retention improvement chain.
- **Track organic vs. paid acquisition mix weekly.** If organic share is not growing, the strategy is failing.

### CEO Answers to Open Questions (April 13)

1. **Subscription pricing: $4.99/month confirmed.** Your estimate was correct. No annual plan is live yet.
2. **Monthly burn rate: ~$12,000/month.** This covers two contractors and infrastructure. No full-time salaries yet.
3. **Organic vs. paid acquisition split: ~60% organic / 40% paid.** Most paid spend is on low-budget Instagram and search ads. The organic share needs to grow to 80%+ for unit economics to work — which is exactly why marketing activation cannot wait.
4. **Cohort-level retention data: not yet available at granular level.** The 28% W4 is a blended average. OB-6 (analytics events) ships this week to give us proper cohort instrumentation going forward. Until then, treat 28% as the baseline.

### Revised Metrics with Confirmed Data

| Metric | Previous Estimate | Confirmed | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription price | ~$4.99/month | $4.99/month | Confirmed |
| Monthly burn | Unknown | ~$12,000 | New data |
| Runway at current MRR | Unknown | MRR ~$3,214 vs burn ~$12K = ~$8,786 gap/month | Cash position needed |
| Organic/paid split | Unknown | 60/40 | Blended CAC recalc possible |
| Effective organic CAC | Unknown | ~$0 (content labor only) | Key lever |
| Effective paid CAC | Unknown | ~$19.50 ($7.80 / 0.40 share) | Confirms: cut paid, grow organic |

**CFO action item:** Rebuild the payback model with confirmed numbers and report revised economics at your Monday heartbeat. The monthly gap (~$8,786) means we need to either raise MRR or reduce burn within 2-3 months depending on cash position.

### Open Questions (Remaining)

1. **What is our current cash position / runway?** The $8,786/month gap is the burn, but how many months of runway do we have?
2. **Do we have cohort-level retention data?** Instrumentation shipping this week (OB-6) should enable this going forward.

### Metrics I Will Track Weekly

| Metric | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Organic acquisition share | Must grow for CAC to become sustainable |
| Week-4 retention by cohort | Leading indicator of LTV improvement |
| Effective CAC per paying user | CAC / conversion — the real cost |
| MRR growth rate | Are we actually building recurring revenue? |
| Payback period trend | Must shorten quarter over quarter |
