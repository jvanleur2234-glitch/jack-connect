# AI Provider Runtime Progress

Date: 2026-04-15

This file records the provider-runtime and live-session migration work completed so far. The goal of this track is to move Cabinet away from hard-coded Claude Code / Codex terminal launching, support multiple providers through a consistent adapter layer, and keep the old CLI path available as an optional experimental fallback.

## 1. Goal

The migration is moving Cabinet toward a Paperclip-style model where:

- provider execution is abstracted behind adapter definitions
- multiple runtimes can coexist under the same conversation/job/persona model
- structured adapters can run detached sessions without relying on prompt injection through a web terminal
- legacy CLI launching remains available as a fallback, but no longer defines the main architecture

## 2. What Has Been Implemented

### 2.1 Adapter Foundation

- Added a shared adapter system under `src/lib/agents/adapters/`.
- Introduced adapter metadata such as:
  - `adapterType`
  - `adapterConfig`
  - execution engine identity
  - provider mapping
- Threaded adapter metadata through:
  - personas
  - jobs
  - conversations
  - daemon sessions

Key commits:

- `7cd6c31` - `feat: scaffold adapter foundation for agent runtime migration`
- `3e30f5a` - `feat: thread adapter metadata through daemon sessions`

### 2.2 Structured Claude and Codex Adapters

- Added structured Claude local execution:
  - `src/lib/agents/adapters/claude-local.ts`
  - `src/lib/agents/adapters/claude-stream.ts`
- Added structured Codex local execution:
  - `src/lib/agents/adapters/codex-local.ts`
  - `src/lib/agents/adapters/codex-stream.ts`
- These adapters parse streamed JSON output into Cabinet-friendly transcript text and usage/session metadata instead of depending on raw PTY replay.
- Added focused adapter tests for both structured runtimes.

Key commits:

- `5aa39a5` - `feat: run claude conversations through structured adapter sessions`
- `0a9e52c` - `feat: run codex conversations through structured adapter sessions`

### 2.3 Daemon Runtime Generalization

- Generalized the daemon so it can manage both:
  - legacy PTY sessions
  - structured adapter-backed sessions
- Structured sessions now stream output into the same conversation store used by the rest of the product.
- Conversation transcript persistence remains the canonical source for live and completed output.

Primary file:

- `server/cabinet-daemon.ts`

### 2.4 Provider and Adapter Selection in Product UI

- Exposed provider adapter metadata through the providers API.
- Added runtime-selection helpers so UI can resolve:
  - provider defaults
  - available adapters per provider
  - explicit adapter override vs inherited default
- Exposed adapter/runtime selection in:
  - agent settings
  - custom agent creation
  - job editor flows
  - mission control agent dialogs

Key commits:

- `5428af5` - `feat: expose adapter selection in agent settings`
- `1e0f1a3` - `feat: expose adapter selection in mission control dialogs`

### 2.5 Legacy Execution Preserved as Optional / Experimental

- Legacy CLI paths are still available for backwards compatibility.
- The intended direction is:
  - structured adapters become the default path
  - legacy CLI execution remains an escape hatch
  - legacy should be treated as optional / experimental, not as the core runtime model
- `WebTerminal` is also being preserved intentionally as a product capability for interactive sessions and future terminal-native features such as Cabinet-managed tmux-like workflows.
- The migration is away from **terminal-first task execution**, not away from the terminal itself.

Current default direction:

- Claude provider defaults to `claude_local`
- Codex provider defaults to `codex_local`
- legacy provider execution remains available through legacy adapter entries

### 2.6 Native Cabinet Live Session UI

- Replaced task live-session rendering that previously depended on `WebTerminal`.
- Added a native Cabinet session renderer that:
  - polls conversation detail from persisted transcript data
  - renders live transcript output using Cabinet-aware formatting
  - automatically switches into structured result view once the run finishes
- Refactored the live/result fetch logic into a shared component:
  - `src/components/agents/conversation-session-view.tsx`

Shared rendering pieces:

- `src/components/agents/conversation-live-view.tsx`
- `src/components/agents/conversation-content-viewer.tsx`
- `src/lib/agents/transcript-parser.ts`

Surfaces now using the native Cabinet live view:

- `src/components/tasks/task-detail-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/jobs/jobs-manager.tsx`
- `src/components/agents/agents-workspace.tsx`

Key commits:

- `85fa8d9` - `feat: replace task live terminal with native view`
- `2357097` - `feat: share native live conversation view`

### 2.7 Shared Task Composer and Runtime Overrides

- Added per-task runtime overrides to manual conversation creation so task launchers can choose:
  - provider
  - adapter type
  - model
- Added a compact runtime picker with a brain icon and provider/model dropdown to the shared task composers.
- Centralized client-side manual conversation creation in:
  - `src/lib/agents/conversation-client.ts`
- Moved the cabinet task entry point onto the shared composer stack so it now reuses:
  - `useComposer`
  - `ComposerInput`
  - `TaskRuntimePicker`
- Preserved cabinet-specific behavior while sharing the implementation:
  - `@agent` switches the assigned cabinet agent
  - `@page` still becomes a tracked page mention
- Normalized task launch behavior across the task board, home screen, agents workspace, AI panel, and status-bar/editor entry points.
- Fixed an inconsistency where task-board "Start now" launches could drop page mentions that were present in the composer.

## 3. Current Architecture Direction

Cabinet now has the core pieces needed for multi-provider, multi-runtime execution:

- adapter registry layer
- structured provider implementations
- daemon support for structured detached sessions
- UI support for choosing runtimes per provider
- native transcript-based live rendering for the main conversation/task surfaces

This is the right base for adding more providers beyond Claude Code and Codex without continuing to duplicate provider-specific terminal orchestration logic.

## 4. Important Files Added or Centralized

Runtime and adapter layer:

- `src/lib/agents/adapters/`
- `src/lib/agents/provider-runtime.ts`
- `server/cabinet-daemon.ts`

Transcript and conversation rendering:

- `src/lib/agents/transcript-parser.ts`
- `src/components/agents/conversation-content-viewer.tsx`
- `src/components/agents/conversation-live-view.tsx`
- `src/components/agents/conversation-session-view.tsx`

Selection and configuration surfaces:

- `src/components/agents/agents-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/composer/composer-input.tsx`
- `src/components/composer/task-runtime-picker.tsx`
- `src/components/cabinets/cabinet-task-composer.tsx`
- `src/components/jobs/jobs-manager.tsx`
- `src/components/tasks/task-detail-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/mission-control/create-agent-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/mission-control/edit-agent-dialog.tsx`
- `src/lib/agents/conversation-client.ts`

## 5. Remaining Follow-Up Work

The migration is not fully complete yet. Important next steps:

- decide surface-by-surface which experiences should be transcript-first and which should remain terminal-first
- extend the native live-session renderer to the remaining `WebTerminal`-based conversation surfaces where interactivity is not actually required, such as:
  - `src/components/agents/agent-detail.tsx`
  - `src/components/agents/agent-live-panel.tsx`
  - any non-interactive portions of `src/components/ai-panel/ai-panel.tsx`
- keep evolving `WebTerminal` as a dedicated interactive subsystem for direct CLI usage, debugging, and future tmux-like Cabinet workflows
- add more providers on top of the adapter system
- make the legacy runtime clearly labeled as optional / experimental in every relevant UI surface
- add more integration coverage around adapter selection and structured session lifecycle
- continue reducing any remaining assumptions that a provider must be a PTY-backed CLI

## 7. Summary

Cabinet is no longer blocked on a terminal-first architecture for agent execution. The adapter layer, structured Claude/Codex runtimes, daemon session generalization, runtime-selection UI, and native transcript-driven live views together form the first working version of a real multi-provider runtime model.

The old CLI path still exists, but the system direction is now clearly toward structured adapters as the default and legacy terminal execution as the optional fallback.
